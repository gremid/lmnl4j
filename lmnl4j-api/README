This Java library provides a LMNL Object Model (LOM) implementation, a model
suited to represent marked-up text with multi-layered annotations, that can
overlap arbitrarily. The basic concepts of a LOM, namely documents, layers,
annotations and ranges, are borrowed from the experimental markup language
LMNL, the "Layered Markup and Annotation Language" as invented by Jeni
Tennison and Wendell Piez.
